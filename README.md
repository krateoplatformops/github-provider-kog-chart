# GitHub Provider KOG Helm Chart

This is a [Helm Chart](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/) that deploys the Krateo GitHub Provider leveraging the [Krateo OASGen Provider](https://github.com/krateoplatformops/oasgen-provider) and using [OpenAPI Specifications (OAS) of the GitHub REST API](https://github.com/github/rest-api-description/blob/main/descriptions/api.github.com/api.github.com.2022-11-28.yaml).
This provider allows you to manage GitHub resources such as repositories, collaborators, teamrepoes, runnergroups and workflows runs in a cloud-native way using the Krateo platform.

## Requirements

[Krateo OASGen Provider](https://github.com/krateoplatformops/oasgen-provider) should be installed in your cluster. Follow the related Helm Chart [README](https://github.com/krateoplatformops/oasgen-provider-chart) for installation instructions.

## How to install

To install the chart, use the following commands:

```sh
helm repo add krateo https://charts.krateo.io
helm repo update krateo
helm install github-provider krateo/github-provider-kog
```

> [!NOTE]
> Due to the nature of the providers leveraging the [Krateo OASGen Provider](https://github.com/krateoplatformops/oasgen-provider), this chart will install a set of RestDefinitions that will in turn trigger the deployment of a set controllers in the cluster. These controllers need to be up and running before you can create or manage resources using the Custom Resources (CRs) defined by this provider. This may take a few minutes after the chart is installed. The RestDefinitions will reach the condition `Ready` when the related CRDs are installed and the controllers are up and running.

You can check the status of the RestDefinitions with the following commands:

```sh
kubectl get restdefinitions.ogen.krateo.io --all-namespaces
```
You should see output similar to this:
```sh
NAMESPACE       NAME                           READY   AGE
krateo-system   github-provider-collaborator   False   24s
krateo-system   github-provider-repo           False   24s
krateo-system   github-provider-runnergroup    False   24s
krateo-system   github-provider-teamrepo       False   24s
krateo-system   github-provider-workflow       False   24s
```

You can also wait for a specific RestDefinition (`github-provider-repo` in this case) to be ready with a command like this:
```sh
kubectl wait restdefinitions.ogen.krateo.io github-provider-repo --for condition=Ready=True --namespace krateo-system --timeout=300s
```

Note that the names of the RestDefinitions and the namespace where the RestDefinitions are installed may vary based on your configuration.

## Supported resources

This chart supports the following resources and operations:

| Resource     | Get  | Create | Update | Delete |
|--------------|------|--------|--------|--------|
| Collaborator | âœ…   | âœ…     | âœ…     | âœ…     |
| Repo         | âœ…   | âœ…     | âœ…     | âœ…     |
| TeamRepo     | âœ…   | âœ…     | âœ…     | âœ…     |
| Workflow     | ðŸš« Not applicable   | âœ…     | ðŸš« Not applicable    | ðŸš« Not applicable     |
| RunnerGroup     | âœ…   | âœ…     | âœ…     | âœ…     |

> [!NOTE]  
> ðŸš« *"Not applicable"* indicates that the operation is not supported by this provider because it probably does not make sense for the resource type.  For example, GitHub Workflow runs are typically not updated or deleted directly; they are triggered and if a new run is needed, a new workflow run is created.

The resources listed above are Custom Resources (CRs) defined in the `github.ogen.krateo.io` API group. They are used to manage GitHub resources in a Kubernetes-native way, allowing you to create, update, and delete GitHub resources using Kubernetes manifests.

### Resource details

#### Repo

The `Repo` resource allows you to create, update, and delete GitHub repositories. 
You can specify the repository name, description, visibility (public or private), and other settings that can be seen in the [GitHub REST API documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos?apiVersion=2022-11-28) and the selected OpenAPI Specification in the `/assets` folder of this chart.

An example of a Repo resource is:
```yaml
apiVersion: github.ogen.krateo.io/v1alpha1
kind: Repo
metadata:
  name: test-repo
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    krateo.io/connector-verbose: "true"
spec:
  configurationRef:
    name: my-repo-config
    namespace: default 
  org: krateoplatformops-test
  name: test-repo
  description: A short description of the repository set by Krateo
  visibility: public
  has_issues: true
```

#### Collaborator 

The `Collaborator` resource allows you to add and remove collaborators from a GitHub repository. 
You can specify the username of the collaborator and the permission level among `admin`, `pull`, `push`, `maintain`, and `triage`.
Using any other value will result in an error or continuous reconciliation loops.
Updating a collaborator's permission level is also supported.

In addition, this resource supports adding "external collaborators" to a repository, meaning users who are not members of the organization that owns the repository.
In this case, an invitation will be sent to the user with the specified permission level.
Updating and deleting invitations is supported through the same `Collaborator` resource.
You can verify whether the user is directly added as a collaborator or if the invitation is pending by checking the `message` field in the Collaborator resource status.
Note that the `Collaborator` resource will remain in a `Pending` state until the user accepts the invitation.

An example of a `Collaborator` resource is:
```yaml
apiVersion: github.ogen.krateo.io/v1alpha1
kind: Collaborator
metadata:
  name: add-collaborator
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    krateo.io/connector-verbose: "true"
spec:
  configurationRef:
    name: my-collaborator-config
    namespace: default 
  owner: krateoplatformops-test
  repo: collaborator-tester
  username: vicentinileonardo
  permission: pull
```

#### TeamRepo

The `TeamRepo` resource allows you to manage team access to GitHub repositories. 
You can specify the `team_slug`, repository name, and permission level among `admin`, `pull`, `push`, `maintain`, and `triage`.

An example of a TeamRepo resource is:
```yaml
apiVersion: github.ogen.krateo.io/v1alpha1
kind: TeamRepo
metadata:
  name: test-teamrepo
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    krateo.io/connector-verbose: "true"
spec:
  configurationRef:
    name: my-teamrepo-config
    namespace: default 
  org: krateoplatformops-test
  owner: krateoplatformops-test
  team_slug: testteam
  repo: teamrepo-tester
  permission: pull
```

#### Workflow

The `Workflow` resource allows you to trigger GitHub Actions workflow runs (`workflow_dispatch`). 
You can specify the repository name, workflow file name, and any input parameters required by the workflow. 
You must configure your GitHub Actions workflow to run when the [`workflow_dispatch` webhook](https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#workflow_dispatch) event occurs. 
The `inputs` must configured in the workflow file.
Please refer to the [GitHub REST API documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/workflows?apiVersion=2022-11-28#create-a-workflow-dispatch-event) for more information.

An example of a Workflow resource is:
```yaml
apiVersion: github.ogen.krateo.io/v1alpha1
kind: Workflow
metadata:
  name: workflow-tester
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    krateo.io/connector-verbose: "true"
spec:
  configurationRef:
    name: my-workflow-config
    namespace: default 
  owner: krateoplatformops-test
  repo: workflow-tester
  workflow_id: test.yaml
  ref: main
  inputs:
    environment: development
    version: "v1.2.3"
    debug_enabled: "false"
    custom_message: "Test 04/06 at 13:42 from Krateo"
```

#### RunnerGroup

The `RunnerGroup` resource allows you to manage GitHub runner groups. You can specify the runner group name, and any additional settings required by the runner group such as `visibility` and `allows_public_repositories`.

An example of a RunnerGroup resource is:
```yaml
apiVersion: github.ogen.krateo.io/v1alpha1
kind: RunnerGroup
metadata:
  name: runnergroup-test
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    krateo.io/connector-verbose: "true"
spec:
  configurationRef:
    name: my-runnergroup-config
    namespace: default
  name: runner-test-by-krateo
  org: krateoplatformops-test
  allows_public_repositories: false
```

### Resource examples

You can find example resources for each supported resource type in the `/samples` folder of the chart.

## Authentication

The authentication to the GitHub REST API is managed using 2 kinds of resources (both are required):

- **Kubernetes Secret**: This resource is used to store the GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) that is used to authenticate with the GitHub REST API. The PAT should have the necessary permissions to manage the resources you want to create or update.

In order to generate a GitHub token, follow this instructions: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic

Example of a Kubernetes Secret that you can apply to your cluster:
```sh
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: gh-token
  namespace: default
type: Opaque
stringData:
  token: <PAT>
EOF
```

Replace `<PAT>` with your actual GitHub Personal Access Token.

- **\<Resource\>Configuration**: These resource can reference the Kubernetes Secret and are used to authenticate with the GitHub REST API. They must be referenced with the `configurationRef` field of the resources defined in this chart. The configuration resource can be in a different namespace than the resource itself.

Note that the specific configuration resource type depends on the resource you are managing. For instance, in the case of the `Repo` resource, you would need a `RepoConfiguration`.

An example of a `RepoConfiguration` resource that references the Kubernetes Secret, to be applied to your cluster:
```sh
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: github.ogen.krateo.io/v1alpha1
kind: RepoConfiguration
metadata:
  name: my-repo-config
  namespace: default
spec:
  authentication:
    bearer:
      # Reference to a secret containing the bearer token
      tokenRef:
        name: gh-token        # Name of the secret
        namespace: default    # Namespace where the secret exists
        key: token            # Key within the secret that contains the token
EOF
```

Then, in the `Repo` resource, you can reference the `RepoConfiguration` resource as follows:
```yaml
apiVersion: github.ogen.krateo.io/v1alpha1
kind: Repo
metadata:
  name: test-repo
spec:
  configurationRef:
    name: my-repo-config
    namespace: default
  org: krateoplatformops-test
  name: test-repo
```

## Configuration

### values.yaml

You can customize the chart by modifying the `values.yaml` file.
For instance, you can select which resources the provider should support in the oncoming installation by setting the `restdefinitions` field in the `values.yaml` file. 
This may be useful if you want to limit the resources managed by the provider to only those you need, reducing the overhead of managing unnecessary controllers.
The default configuration enables all resources supported by the chart.

### Verbose logging

In order to enable verbose logging for the controllers, you can add the `krateo.io/connector-verbose: "true"` annotation to the metadata of the resources you want to manage, as shown in the examples above. 
This will enable verbose logging for those specific resources, which can be useful for debugging and troubleshooting as it will provide more detailed information about the operations performed by the controllers.

## Chart structure

Main components of the chart:

- **RestDefinitions**: These are the core resources needed to manage resources leveraging the Krateo OASGen Provider. In this case, they refers to the OpenAPI Specification to be used for the creation of the Custom Resources (CRs) that represent GitHub resources.
They also define the operations that can be performed on those resources. Once the chart is installed, RestDefinitions will be created and as a result, specific controllers will be deployed in the cluster to manage the resources defined with those RestDefinitions.

- **ConfigMaps**: Refer directly to the OpenAPI Specification content in the `/assets` folder.

- **/assets** folder: Contains the selected OpenAPI Specification files for the GitHub REST API.

- **/samples** folder: Contains example resources for each supported resource type as seen in this README. These examples demonstrate how to create and manage GitHub resources using the Krateo GitHub Provider KOG.

- **Deployment**: Deploys a [plugin](https://github.com/krateoplatformops/github-rest-dynamic-controller-plugin) that is used as a proxy to resolve some inconsistencies of the GitHub REST API. The specific endpoins managed by the plugin are described in the [plugin README](https://github.com/krateoplatformops/github-rest-dynamic-controller-plugin/blob/main/README.md)

- **Service**: Exposes the plugin described above, allowing the resource controllers to communicate with the GitHub REST API through the plugin, only if needed.

## Troubleshooting

For troubleshooting, you can refer to the [Troubleshooting guide](./docs/troubleshooting.md) in the `/docs` folder of this chart. 
It contains common issues and solutions related to this chart.
