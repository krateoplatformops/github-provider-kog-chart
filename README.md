# GitHub Provider Helm Chart

This is a [Helm Chart](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/) that deploys the Krateo GitHub Provider leveraging the [Krateo OASGen Provider](https://github.com/krateoplatformops/oasgen-provider) and using [OpenAPI Specifications (OAS) of the GitHub API](https://github.com/github/rest-api-description/blob/main/descriptions/api.github.com/api.github.com.2022-11-28.yaml).
This provider allows you to manage GitHub resources such as repositories, collaborators, and workflow runs using the Krateo platform.

> [!NOTE]  
> This chart is going to replace the [original Krateo github-provider](https://github.com/krateoplatformops/github-provider) in the future.

## How to install

To install the chart, use the following commands:

```sh
helm repo add krateo https://charts.krateo.io
helm repo update krateo
helm install github-provider krateo/github-provider-kog
```

> [!NOTE]
> Due to the nature of the providers leveraging the [Krateo OASGen Provider](https://github.com/krateoplatformops/oasgen-provider), this chart will install a set of RestDefinitions that will in turn trigger the deployment of controllers in the cluster. These controllers need to be up and running before you can create or manage resources using the Custom Resources (CRs) defined by this provider. This may take a few minutes after the chart is installed.

You can check the status of the controllers by running:
```sh
until kubectl get deployment github-provider-<RESOURCE>-controller -n <YOUR_NAMESPACE> &>/dev/null; do
  echo "Waiting for <RESOURCE> controller deployment to be created..."
  sleep 5
done
kubectl wait deployments github-provider-<RESOURCE>-controller --for condition=Available=True --namespace <YOUR_NAMESPACE> --timeout=300s
```

Make sure to replace `<RESOURCE>` to one of the resources supported by the chart, such as `repo`, `collaborator`, `teamrepo`, or `workflow`.

## Supported resources

This chart supports the following resources and operations:

| Resource     | Get  | Create | Update | Delete |
|--------------|------|--------|--------|--------|
| Collaborator | âœ…   | âœ…     | âœ…     | âœ…     |
| Repo         | âœ…   | âœ…     | âœ…     | âœ…     |
| TeamRepo     | âœ…   | âœ…     | âœ…     | âœ…     |
| Workflow     | âœ…   | âœ…     | ðŸš« Not applicable    | ðŸš« Not applicable     |
| RunnerGroup     | âœ…   | âœ…     | âœ…     | âœ…     |

> [!NOTE]  
> ðŸš« *"Not applicable"* indicates that the operation is not supported because it probably does not make sense for the resource type.  For example, GitHub Workflow runs are typically not updated or deleted directly; they are triggered and if a new run is needed, a new workflow run is created.

The resources listed above are Custom Resources (CRs) defined in the `github.krateo.io` API group. They are used to manage GitHub resources in a Kubernetes-native way, allowing you to create, update, and delete GitHub resources using Kubernetes manifests.

### Resource details

#### Repo

The `Repo` resource allows you to create, update, and delete GitHub repositories. You can specify the repository name, description, visibility (public or private), and other settings that can be seen in the [GitHub API documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos?apiVersion=2022-11-28) and the selected OpenAPI Specification in the `/assets` folder of this chart.
An example of a Repo resource is:
```yaml
apiVersion: github.krateo.io/v1alpha1
kind: Repo
metadata:
  name: test-repo1
  namespace: ghp
  annotations:
    krateo.io/connector-verbose: "true"
spec:
  authenticationRefs:
    bearerAuthRef: bearer-gh-ref
  org: krateoplatformops-test
  name: test-repo1
  description: A short description of the repository set by Krateo
  visibility: public
  has_issues: true
```

#### Collaborator 

The `Collaborator` resource allows you to add or remove collaborators from a GitHub repository. You can specify the username of the collaborator and the permission level among `admin`, `pull`, `push`, `maintain`, and `triage`.

An example of a Collaborator resource is:
```yaml
apiVersion: github.krateo.io/v1alpha1
kind: Collaborator
metadata:
  name: add-collaborator
  namespace: ghp
  annotations:
    krateo.io/connector-verbose: "true"
spec:
  authenticationRefs:
    bearerAuthRef: bearer-gh-ref
  owner: krateoplatformops-test
  repo: collaborator-tester
  username: vicentinileonardo
  permission: pull
```

#### TeamRepo

The `TeamRepo` resource allows you to manage team access to GitHub repositories. You can specify the `team_slug`, repository name, and permission level among `admin`, `pull`, `push`, `maintain`, and `triage`.

> [!NOTE]
> The `TeamRepo` resource is not a standard GitHub resource but allows you to manage team access to repositories in a way that is consistent with the other resources in this chart.

An example of a TeamRepo resource is:
```yaml
apiVersion: github.krateo.io/v1alpha1
kind: TeamRepo
metadata:
  name: test-teamrepo
  namespace: ghp
  annotations:
    krateo.io/connector-verbose: "true"
spec:
  authenticationRefs:
    bearerAuthRef: bearer-gh-ref
  org: krateoplatformops-test
  owner: krateoplatformops-test
  team_slug: testteam
  repo: teamrepo-tester
  permission: pull
```

#### Workflow

The `Workflow` resource allows you to trigger workflow runs in a GitHub repository. You can specify the repository name, workflow file name, and any input parameters required by the workflow. 

An example of a Workflow resource is:
```yaml
apiVersion: github.krateo.io/v1alpha1
kind: Workflow
metadata:
  name: workflow-tester
  namespace: ghp
  annotations:
    krateo.io/connector-verbose: "true"
spec:
  authenticationRefs:
    bearerAuthRef: bearer-gh-ref
  owner: krateoplatformops-test
  repo: workflow-tester
  workflow_id: test.yaml
  ref: main
  inputs:
    environment: development
    version: "v1.2.3"
    debug_enabled: "false"
    custom_message: "Test 04/06 at 13:42 from Krateo"
```

#### RunnerGroup

The `RunnerGroup` resource allows you to manage GitHub runner groups. You can specify the runner group name, and any additional settings required by the runner group such as `visibility` and `allows_public_repositories`.

An example of a RunnerGroup resource is:
```yaml
apiVersion: github.krateo.io/v1alpha1
kind: RunnerGroup
metadata:
  name: runnergroup-test
  namespace: ghp
  annotations:
    krateo.io/connector-verbose: "true"
spec:
  authenticationRefs:
    bearerAuthRef: bearer-gh-ref
  name: runner-test-by-krateo
  org: krateoplatformops-test
  visibility: private
  allows_public_repositories: false
```

## Authentication

The authentication to the GitHub API is managed using 2 resources (both are required):

- **Kubernetes Secret**: This resource is used to store the GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) that is used to authenticate with the GitHub API. The PAT should have the necessary permissions to manage the resources you want to create or update.

In order to generate a GitHub token, follow this instructions: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic

Example of a Kubernetes Secret:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: gh-token
  namespace: krateo-system
type: Opaque
stringData:
  token: <PAT>
```

Replace `<PAT>` with your actual GitHub Personal Access Token which should look like `ghp_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`.

- **BearerAuth**: This resource references the Kubernetes Secret and is used to authenticate with the GitHub API. It is used in the `authenticationRefs` field of the resources defined in this chart.

Example of a BearerAuth resource:
```yaml
apiVersion: github.krateo.io/v1alpha1
kind: BearerAuth
metadata:
  name: bearer-gh-ref
  namespace: ghp
spec:
  tokenRef:
    key: token
    name: gh-token
    namespace: krateo-system
```

## Configuration

You can customize the chart by modifying the `values.yaml` file.
For instance, you can select which resources the provider should support in the oncoming installation by setting the `restdefinitions` field in the `values.yaml` file. The default configuration enables all resources supported by the chart.

## Chart structure

Main components of the chart:

- **RestDefinitions**: These are the core resources needed to manage resources leveraging the Krateo OASGen Provider. In this case, they refers to the OpenAPI Specification to be used for the creation of the Custom Resources (CRs) that represent GitHub resources.
They also define the operations that can be performed on those resources. Once the chart is installed, RestDefinitions will be created and as a result, specific controllers will be deployed in the cluster to manage the resources defined with those RestDefinitions.

- **ConfigMaps**: Refer directly to the OpenAPI Specification content in the `/assets` folder.

- **/assets** folder: Contains the selected OpenAPI Specification files for the GitHub API.

- **/samples** folder: Contains example resources for each supported resource type as seen in this README. These examples demonstrate how to create and manage GitHub resources using the Krateo GitHub Provider.

- **Deployment**: Deploys a [plugin](https://github.com/krateoplatformops/github-rest-dynamic-controller-plugin) that is used as a proxy for the GitHub API to resolve some inconsistencies in the OpenAPI Specification. The spacific endpoins managed by the plugin are described in the [plugin README](https://github.com/krateoplatformops/github-rest-dynamic-controller-plugin/blob/main/README.md)

- **Service**: Exposes the plugin described above, allowing the resource controllers to communicate with the GitHub API through the plugin, if needed.

## Requirements

[Krateo OASGen Provider](https://github.com/krateoplatformops/oasgen-provider) should be installed in your cluster. Follow the related Helm Chart [README](https://github.com/krateoplatformops/oasgen-provider-chart) for installation instructions.
